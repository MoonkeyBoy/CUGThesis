# CUGThesis
The \Latex Template for the Master Degree Graduate Thesis writing in China University of Geosciences.

This is a \Latex Template for Thesis Writing by Seeksky@CUG. Welcome to my homepage http://jinlaixu.net .
The Template is modified from the universal thesis template in USTC. Thanks very much for their effort in the template.  

# Intro
Please use \Xelatex for compiling the files. Maybe TextLive is better for the template, because I didn't test the availability when using MikTex.

Needed Files:
 * cugthesis.cls: all in one style class.
 * cugbib.bst: style for \Bibtex.
 * main.tex: the main file of the thesis with some examples of it.
 * clean.bat/sh: clean bash.
 * make.bat/sh: make bash.
 * /chapter: with all the subsection files in it including the abstract and so on.
 * /bib: just \Bibtex files for references.
 * /figures: the directory for figures. Please use PDF, EPS ans so on.
